TODO:

Differentiate moving/movable objects from static ones.
Moving platform imporvements: make jumping off a moving platform work
    Currently player teleports to the bottom of a platform if they attempt to jump off it.
    Weirdness when jumping onto a corner

LATER:
Potentially better physics
Integrated Level editor

DONE:

Moving platforms (very barebones implementation (buggy))
Load the level that was made in Tiled into the game.
Level exit
Time keeping
Camera movement
Jumping
